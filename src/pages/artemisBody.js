                        to elaborate on their expectations and desires for the redesign. This collaborative approach

                        Throughout the redesign process, we remained mindful of the client's objectives
                        and goals. Our user interviews highlighted a shared sentiment among existing 
                        members - a perceived lack of clarity and purpose in the website. 
                        Users commonly cited difficulties in locating information or grappling with 
                        outdated content. The original design suffered from a lack of organization and poor information architecture (IA),
                        leading users to prefer inquiring directly rather than navigating the website. <br/><br/>

                        To tackle this, we revamped the page functions, ensuring fresh content on each page and 
                        introducing a dedicated hub for current and upcoming events. 
                        We also restructured the projects page, separating current and past projects for 
                        improved accessibility.  This redesign focused on enhancing the information architecture, 
                        providing users with a clearer and more organized pathway through the website.
                        <br/><br/>

                        To optimize the user journey, we strategically integrated additional links on each page. 
                        This intentional connectivity streamlines user navigation, ultimately contributing to enhanced 
                        retention rates. Furthermore, we implemented a responsive design that seamlessly transitions to 
                        mobile platforms. In contrast to the previous version, which was primarily readable on laptops or 
                        computers, 
                        the new design ensures the website is accessible on portable devices as well. <br/> <br/>

                        After careful consideration, experimenting with various designs, and holding multiple meetings with our client, we settled on the final designs. 
                        We then transferred our Figma files to a WebFlow webpage.

                        YAY! With that my first client redesign project is concluded. Througout this project 
                        I was able to learn alot about the full design process. PRETTY DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN 
                        FUNCTIONAL. It was important to remember that functionality has to go hand in hand
                        with the design. <br/><br/>

                        <span>Designing with Development in Mind:</span><br/>
                        As we approached the final steps of transferring the designs to Webflow, we 
                        encountered a challenge. Our team had to reevaluate certain design choices to 
                        ensure optimal functionality post-development.<br/><br/>

                        <span>Information Architecture:</span><br/>
                        This project really stressed the significance of Information Archiecture. 
                        How data is presented significantly influences its interpretation. 
                        We optimized the information architecture by enhancing the labeling system, 
                        organizational scheme, and overall data structure.<br/><br/>
                        <span>Harmonizing User Needs with Client Preferences:</span><br/>
                        Balancing user preferences with client expectations and requirements was a key aspect of this project. 
                        We skillfully took the collected data to tailor the website to user preferences while considering the client's expectations.
                         Negotiating design choices led to a harmonious outcome that satisfied everyone involved.
